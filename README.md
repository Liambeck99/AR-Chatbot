## Description
Universities can be a dauniting place for the newcomer. Too much infomation in too short a time to retain, unfamilar locations, lectures and seminars at hard to find rooms. 
Very may of the same questions are asked repeatedly:
- "Tell  me about the university"
- "Where exactly am I now?"
- "Where is the Students Union/Computer Science Labs/etc from here?"
- "What COVID policy should I be aware of?"
- "Show me a map of the University"
- etc

Can we create an Augmented Reality avatar with IBM Watson Assistant. that can answer students questions in a way that is compelling and easy to use. https://trello.com/c/vjR7ptSt/40-augmented-reality-artificially-intelligent-avatar-for-your-university-compsci

## Setting up Project in Unity
*This is a guide for install on windows with an app build aimed at android devices, mileage may vary for different OS.*

### Install Unity 
Unity hub can be downloaded here https://unity.com/download, once installed create an account or sign into unity.

Click **SKIP INSTALL** when asked as we require an older version of Unity.

Specifically we require **Unity 2019.4.26** which can be downloaded here https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive. 
Given you have already installed unity hub choose the unity hub install option.
